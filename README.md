# pi-config

Personal configuration for [Pi](https://pi.dev) — a minimal, extensible terminal coding agent (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`). `~/.pi` is symlinked to the root of this repo (`base/` lives directly at the repo root) so settings, models, and credential _references_ stay version-controlled and portable across machines.

## Setup

1. Symlink this repo to `~/.pi`:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/oh-my-pi ~/.pi
   ```
2. Copy the env template and fill in your keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```
3. Source it before starting Pi — Pi does not auto-load `.env` files, so this must happen every session:
   ```bash
   source .env && pi
   ```

```

## Authentication (`auth.json`)

Pi resolves provider credentials in this order: CLI `--api-key` flag → `auth.json` entry → environment variable → `models.json` `apiKey`. `auth.json` entries support `$ENV_VAR` interpolation, so the file can reference `.env` without ever storing a literal secret:

```jsonc
{
  "anthropic": {
    "type": "oauth",
    "refresh": "...",
    "access": "...",
    "expires": 0,
  }, // set via /login
  "openai": { "type": "api_key", "key": "$OPENAI_API_KEY" },
  "google": { "type": "api_key", "key": "$GEMINI_API_KEY" },
  "openrouter": { "type": "api_key", "key": "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" },
}
```

- `anthropic` stays on OAuth (Claude Pro/Max subscription billing) — set inside Pi with `/login`, not from `.env`.
- `openai`, `google`, and `openrouter` resolve from the matching `.env` variable at request time.
- Each provider key holds **either** an OAuth entry **or** an API-key entry, never both at once — pick one per provider.
- `$VAR` interpolation only reads what's already in the process environment when `pi` starts — run `source .env` first.

## Extending Pi

Two tiers, kept deliberately separate:

- **Global** — `agent/{prompts,skills,extensions,themes}/`. This repo's root is symlinked to `~/.pi`, so anything here resolves as `~/.pi/agent/...` and auto-loads in every project. Only `themes/` is populated so far, as a symlink to the repo-root `themes/` directory (see below) — `prompts/`, `skills/`, `extensions/` are still empty.
- **Project-local, opt-in** — `extensions/*.ts` at the repo root, kept as a sibling of `agent/` rather than nested inside it, so extensions never become global or get auto-loaded by Pi; they're loaded explicitly, by name, via the `piext()` shell function (see below). `themes/*.json` also lives at the repo root as the canonical source, but is exposed globally via the `base/agent/themes` symlink rather than being project-local-only.

Current extensions (`extensions/`):

| File                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme-map.ts`               | Shared helper, not an extension itself — per-extension theme/title assignment on `session_start`                                            |
| `damage-control.ts`          | Rule-based safety gate for the current project (`.pi/damage-control-rules.yaml`) — hard blocks and tells the agent to stop and ask the user |
| `damage-control-continue.ts` | Same rules, but the block feedback lets the agent keep working past non-destructive violations                                              |
| `theme-cycler.ts`            | F2/Ctrl+Q to cycle themes, `/theme` to pick one, status line + swatch widget                                                                |
| `minimal.ts`                 | Replaces the footer with just model name + a 10-block context usage bar                                                                     |
| `plan-mode/`                 | `/plan` or `Ctrl+Alt+P` toggles read-only exploration (disables `edit`/`write`, tokenizes/allowlists `bash`), owns a `plan_mode_question` clarifying-questions tool, extracts a numbered plan, tracks `[DONE:n]` progress during execution — base ported from Pi's own `examples/extensions/plan-mode/`, bash-safety + question-tool ported from [narumiruna/pi-extensions](https://github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions) |

Run via `piext` (a shell function in `~/.dotfiles/functions_zsh`, not part of this repo) — pass extension names, mix any combination, from any project directory. `piext` resolves each name to `extensions/<name>.ts` or `extensions/<name>/index.ts` and runs plain `pi -e ...` with absolute paths; nothing loads unless you name it:

```bash
piext                                          # or piext --list: show available extension names
piext damage-control minimal theme-cycler      # hard-block safety gate + minimal footer + theme cycling
piext damage-control-continue minimal theme-cycler  # adaptive-continue variant of the above
piext theme-cycler minimal                     # just the theme cycler + minimal footer
piext plan-mode minimal theme-cycler           # plan mode + minimal footer + theme cycling
```

Short aliases (`pi:dc`, `pi:dcc`, `pi:theme`, `pi:plan`, `pi:list`) wrap the common combos above — see `~/.dotfiles/aliases.zsh`.

For extensions you want *always* loaded (no `piext`/`-e` needed at all), run `npm run toggle-extensions` (or `node scripts/toggle-extensions.mjs`) — an interactive checkbox picker (`@inquirer/prompts`) that writes **relative** paths into `base/agent/settings.json`'s `packages` array, as local package sources. Two things this deliberately avoids, confirmed by reading the installed package's own source (`dist/core/package-manager.js`, `dist/core/resource-loader.js`) rather than assumed from docs:

- **Not the plain `extensions` array** (docs/extensions.md's "additional paths via settings.json") — that one resolves relative paths against `cwd`, which would break depending on where `pi` happens to be launched from, and only absolute paths are actually stable there — which is exactly what we don't want baked into a version-controlled file.
- **Not a symlink into `base/agent/extensions/`** — every extension here imports `./theme-map.ts`, and jiti (Pi's `.ts` loader) resolves relative imports via Node's classic CJS algorithm, which does not resolve a symlinked directory's realpath first. A symlink-based version of this was tried and reverted because that import silently failed to resolve.

The `packages` array's local-path entries resolve relative paths against `agentDir` (`base/agent/`) specifically — portable across machines, no absolute path ever committed, and it correctly falls back to treating a bare directory with no `package.json` (like `plan-mode/`) as a single directory-style extension.

All 11 custom themes are available everywhere `pi` runs — `base/agent/themes` is a symlink to the repo-root `themes/` directory, so Pi's own global theme discovery (`~/.pi/agent/themes/`) picks them up without any extension needing to register the path itself.

Run `/prime` in Claude Code inside this repo for a full onboarding guide to Pi's capabilities and this config's current state.

## Security

- `auth.json`, `agent/*-memory`, `sessions/`, and `.env` are gitignored — never commit real credentials.
- `auth.json` should only ever contain OAuth tokens (from `/login`) or `$ENV_VAR` references — no literal API keys belong in this repo.
